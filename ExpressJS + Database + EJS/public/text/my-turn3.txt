I'm 13 and I was born and raised in Plano, Texas and I go to Renner Middle School here in town. When I was about to turn 11, my mom kept asking me over and over what I wanted to do for my birthday and I finally decided I wanted to help feed the homeless. I remember mom asked me if I wanted to serve sandwiches and chips and I explained that I would like to give people an Easter dinner. From there, we contacted many homeless shelters and Dallas Life Homeless Shelter responded. They let us know that they had around 250 people we could help.

At first we didn't know what we were doing, we just started a GoFundMe and we shared it on Facebook. But we ended up raising $12,500 and providing dinner for 350 people at the shelter. For that first Easter event we were at the shelter for two or three hours and we were able to have 20 volunteers helping us. We served chicken, turkey ham and all the sides; everything you'd have at an Easter dinner type meal. On that day I was so excited, getting to see those people's smiles made my heart warm. I felt like I was making God proud.

A few months later, lawyers were calling my mom asking if I had created a non-profit yet. We didn't even know what that was, so my mom was confused. I didn't know anything about them either. But, we did all the paperwork and had someone help us and set up my non-profit, Never Too Young To Care. I think I am one of very few 11-year-olds to have a non-profit organization.
