The morning of December 10 was just a regular day. I had a few errands to run around San Antonio, and one of those involved stopping at the ATM to make a deposit. It was when I was at the ATM that I started to see black smoke come up on the other side of the highway. There were a good number of cars in front of me and so I watched and noticed it was getting bigger after four or five minutes.

We're in the middle of the city so usually response to a fire is pretty quick and so when it was getting bigger I assumed they hadn't got to it yet. But I didn't think much of it as in a big city you might see some sort of fire or smoke once a week.

I'm really familiar with that area, my gym is close by. So I wondered whether it could be my gym and after watching for a few minutes and seeing it was a really heavy, dark smoke I thought that once I was done with the ATM I would go and see if there was something I could do to help, expecting maybe I could guide traffic or help keep people back.
