Ilive in Nazareth, Pennsylvania which is about 1hr and 30 minutes each way between New York City and Philadelphia. I'm married with a one-year-old daughter, and my wife and I have lived here our entire lives.

We had a couple of vacations cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic and there were no concerts or sporting events to go to. Then, one day in July I looked down and realized I'd been to Chick-fil-A for 12 days in a row. I remember thinking that there had to be a record.

I looked it up online and the unofficial record was by a guy in California who had been to Chick-fil-A for 114 days consecutively not including Sundays when they are closed. I thought I could probably do that. It was a long way away, but I felt it would give me something to look forward to.
